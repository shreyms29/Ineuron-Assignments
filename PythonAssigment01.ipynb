    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "\n",
    "6 \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Expression are (* , - , / )\n",
    "     Values are ('hello' , -87.8 , 6 )\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A string is a reference datatype which represents the text type data which is enclosed in \"\".\n",
    "     A variable works as a temporary storeage location which is used to represent any value.\n",
    "     For Example, s = \"hello world\" here s is a variable and \"hello world\" is a string.\n",
    "     \n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The three different datatype are \n",
    "    1. Numeric type : int.\n",
    "    2. Text type : string.\n",
    "    3. Mapping type : dict.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : An Expression is made up of a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that always produces or returns a result value. An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.\n",
    "      All expressions are trying to evaluate to produce some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The difference between expression ans statements are\n",
    "\n",
    "-- An Expression always evaluates to a value. A statement executes something  \n",
    "-- Evaluation of an expression always Produces or returns a result value. Execution of a statement may or may not produces or displays a result value, it only does whatever the statement says\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: After running the above code , output is bacon = 22 \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' *3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "     'spam' *3 = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "     \n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 100 is a invalid because variable names cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The correct way is 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n",
